# 🟠 Conquer Agency Website

**A full-screen, modern creative agency portfolio website featuring advanced scrolling mechanics, dynamic animations, and a bespoke user experience.**

This project is a showcase of front-end development using modern techniques to create a smooth, visually engaging user interface.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Smooth Scrolling:** Implemented using **Locomotive Scroll** for a custom, performance-optimized scrolling experience.
* **Dynamic Animations:** Utilizes **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** and **ScrollTrigger** for sophisticated, scroll-based animations on elements like text, sections, and the footer.
* **Custom Cursor:** A bespoke cursor that changes size and color/text based on the section it hovers over (`#page1` and `#page4`).
* **Pre-loader Animation:** A engaging loading sequence that animates in text before displaying the main content.
* **Interactive Menu Panel:** A side-sliding menu triggered on hover, with staggered link animations.
* **Image Slider:** A visually appealing 3D Coverflow slider powered by **Swiper.js** on `#page5`.
* **Responsive Design:** Includes basic media queries to ensure decent viewing on smaller screens (e.g., in the footer and menu).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** (Structure)
* **CSS3** (Styling, Custom Fonts, Sphere Animation)
* **JavaScript** (Interactivity and Logic)
* **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** For all major animations.
* **Locomotive Scroll:** For the main scrolling mechanism.
* **ScrollTrigger (GSAP Plugin):** To link GSAP animations to the custom scroll position.
* **Swiper.js:** For the interactive image carousel.
* **RemixIcon:** For vector icons used in the footer.

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Conquer-Agency-Website.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Conquer-Agency-Website.git)
    cd Conquer-Agency-Website
    ```
2.  **Open the file:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. This project is purely front-end and requires no server setup.

### ⚠️ Note on Assets:

The project uses several external media files (`.mp4` videos and `.ttf` fonts) that are not included in this code-only file list. To run the project exactly as intended, you will need to replace the placeholder links with your own assets or acquire the necessary video files (`7710243-uhd_3840_2160_30fps.mp4`, `Z2BZfpbqstJ98kkB_RJ-HIGHLIGHT-Work-01.mp4`, etc.) and font files.

## 📄 File Structure

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `website link` |(https://ashishkfrontend.github.io/Conquer-Agency-Website/) | 
| `index.html` | The main HTML structure, including links to external libraries and all sections. |
| `style.css` | All the styling for the website, including custom fonts and responsive media queries. |
| `script.js` | Contains all the JavaScript logic, including the setup for Locomotive Scroll, GSAP animations, the custom cursor, Swiper, and the loader. |
| `*.mp4`, `*.avif` | Placeholder video and image assets for different sections (not included in the provided code). |

## 💡 Customization

* **Fonts:** Update the `@font-face` rules in `style.css` with your preferred font files.
* **Colors:** Modify the primary color variable (e.g., `#ff5f38` for the cursor) in `style.css`.
* **Animations:** The GSAP timelines in `script.js` (e.g., `page2Animation`, `footerAnimation`) can be tweaked to change the animation's timing, duration, and effects.
